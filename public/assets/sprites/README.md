# Game Sprites

This directory contains sprite assets for the Beach Panic game.

## Structure

- `player/` - Player character sprites (6 archetypes)
- `shark/` - Shark sprites (body, fin)
- `npc/` - NPC character sprites (7 types)
- `beach/` - Beach environment props

## Current Status

The sprites in this directory are **placeholder SVG graphics** that have been converted to PNG format. They provide basic visual distinction between characters while maintaining small file sizes.

## Future Improvements

For production, consider:
- Professional sprite artwork
- Animation sprite sheets
- Higher resolution with proper scaling
- Consistent art style across all sprites
- Additional visual effects and details

## File Format

All sprites are PNG with transparency, optimized for web delivery (<50KB each).
