# Beach Panic: Jaws Royale - Development Plan

## Initial Development Steps
1. Set up Next.js 15 with TypeScript strict mode
2. Install dependencies: convex, @vercel/ai, pixi.js@8, gsap
3. Create Convex schema for multiplayer
4. Build basic beach scene with Pixi.js
5. Implement player movement and swimming
6. Add shark with basic AI
7. Integrate Vercel AI SDK for intelligent behavior
8. Add multiplayer sync through Convex

## Key Implementation Notes
- The shark's intelligence should feel genuinely menacing through psychological warfare
- Players should realize the shark remembers them from previous games
- Every death should be memeable with polaroid captures
- The game should feel premium despite being hilarious
- Use AI to create emergent, unpredictable gameplay

## Environment Variables Needed
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY= (for local dev only)
```

## Success Metrics
- Viral clips of shark calling players by name
- Players returning to see if shark remembers them
- Streamers getting unique content every session
- Premium subscriptions for intelligent shark mode

Build this game to be the definitive Jaws anniversary experience - genuinely scary through AI intelligence, genuinely funny through absurd scenarios, and genuinely replayable through emergent AI-driven gameplay.

IMPORTANT: Start by creating a basic beach scene with a swimming player, then incrementally add features. Focus on making the core loop fun before adding all the AI complexity.
