# Beach Panic: Jaws Royale - Concept and Style

## Core Concept
Players join as different beach-goer archetypes trying to complete ridiculous objectives while a player-controlled shark (or AI if no one wants to be the shark) hunts them. Think Fall Guys meets Jaws meets TikTok beach culture.

## Visual Style
- **Aesthetic**: 1970s resort poster meets modern flat design
- **Colors**: 
  - Hot Pink (#FF6B6B)
  - Electric Blue (#4ECDC4) 
  - Warning Orange (#FFA07A)
  - Sand (#F4E6D9)
- **Effects**: Stylized cel-shaded water, chromatic aberration, hand-drawn borders
- **Death Style**: Polaroid freeze-frames with funny captions
